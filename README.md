# DynamicLandingPage_JS
This project was developed to create an inspiring, welcoming, and dynamic landing page.
The name and focus contents are editable and will be saved through the local storage so even if the webpage reloads, the information will retain unless edited. Also, the background images are considered dynamic as it changes depending whether it is, morning, afternoon, or evening. That same applies to the greetings.

### Quick Note
The images used were from unsplash.com and I do not rightfully own the jpg files.
